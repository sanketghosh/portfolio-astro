      I'm a developer and undergrad student from India, deeply passionate about building softwares. I'm always pushing myself to explore new
      horizons and push the limits of what's possible in this ever-evolving
      field.

    <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-zinc-400">I thoroughly enjoy working with TypeScript and JavaScript, finding immense satisfaction in crafting solutions with these languages. However, when I'm not immersed in them, I often find myself exploring Rust or diving into various other realms of computer science.</p>
